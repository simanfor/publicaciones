	abstract = {Forest models predict tree and stand evolution under different scenarios, thereby supporting decision-making in forest management. Models are complex structures composed of sub-models that estimate forest variables at tree and stand levels. Prediction accuracy has generally been evaluated independently of the model. Integrated sub-models make forest models easier to use and provide predictions for growth, survival, ingrowth and many other tree and stand variables with reduced effort. However, while individual submodel validation is widely practiced and normally done by each author individually, joint model validation remains less explored. This study deploys a useful methodology for evaluating and validating models. After comparing observed and predicted data, several case studies were then proposed to improve the accuracy of the joint model. We used the IBERO model, data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory and the SIMANFOR simulator platform. The accuracy of growth submodels was improved by calibrating their equations, though accuracy was not improved in survival and ingrowth submodels.},

	abstract = {Mixed forests are crucial to climate resilience in Mediterranean ecosystems and show great potential for mitigating the effects of climate change. Proper parameterization and integration of mixed-forest models into simulation platforms open the possibility to explore and assess alternative silvicultural paths. In this study, a climate-sensitive growth model for mixed forests was implemented on SIMANFOR, offering parameterizations for 29 species mixtures including the most frequent in Spain. After describing the model implementation process and its potential applications, a case study is presented to show the mixed-model performance, thus using data from the Spanish Fourth National Forest Inventory (SNFI4) and previously developed silviculture scenarios for Castilla and Leon region (Spain). The case study analysed four different mixtures of Pinus sylvestris with Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus pyrenaica, which were selected for their complementarity, productivity, and resource-use efficiency. The results show that thinned mixed stands exhibited higher quadratic mean diameter, biomass and carbon content compared to unthinned stands. The differences observed in biomass and carbon allocation among silvicultural scenarios were consistent in all mixtures. This case study shows how simulations can play a crucial role in understanding the potential of different silvicultural alternatives and in orientating forest management guidelines.},

	abstract = {Long-term field-data series were used to fit a mushroom productivity model. Simulations enabled us to predict the consequences of management and climate scenarios on potential mushroom productivity. Mushrooms play an important ecological and economic role in forest ecosystems. Human interest in collecting mushrooms for self-consumption is also increasing, giving forests added value for providing recreational services. Pinus pinaster Ait. is a western Mediterranean species of great economic and ecological value. Over 7.5\% of the total European distribution of the species is found on the Castilian Plateau in central Spain, where a great variety of mushrooms can be harvested. The aim of this study was to model and simulate mushroom productivity in Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) ecosystems in northern Spain under different silvicultural and climatic scenarios. A mixed model was fitted that related total mushroom productivity to stand and weather variables. The model was uploaded to the SiManFor platform to study the effect of different silvicultural and climatic scenarios on mushroom productivity. The selected independent variables in the model were the ratio between stand basal area and density as a stand management indicator, along with precipitation and average temperatures for September and November. The simulation results also showed that silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, which was higher in scenarios with moderate and high thinning intensities. The impact was highly positive in wetter scenarios, though only slightly positive and negative responses were observed in hotter and drier scenarios, respectively. Silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, especially in wetter scenarios. Precipitation had greater influence than temperature on total mushroom productivity in Maritime pine stands. The results of this paper will enable forest managers to develop optimal management approaches for P. pinaster forests that integrate Non-Wood Forest Products resources. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Adapting forests to climate change is a critical issue for forest management. It requires an understanding of climate effects on forest systems and the ability to forecast how these effects may change over time. We used Spanish Second National Forest Inventory data and the SIMANFOR platform to simulate the evolution of CO2 stock (CO2 Mg · ha−1) and accumulation rates (CO2 Mg · ha−1 · year−1) for the 2000–2100 period in pure and mixed stands managed under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in Spain. We hypothesized that (1) the more optimistic climate scenarios (SSP1 {\textgreater} {\textgreater} SSP5) would have higher CO2 stock and accumulation rates; (2) mixed stands would have higher CO2 stock and accumulation rates than pure stands; and (3) the behavior of both variables would vary based on forest composition (conifer–conifer vs. conifer–broadleaf). We focused on Pinus sylvestris L., and its main mixtures with Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus pyrenaica. The SSP scenarios had correlating CO2 stock values in which SSP1 {\textgreater} SSP2 {\textgreater} SSP3 {\textgreater} SSP5, ranging from the most optimistic (SSP1) to the most pessimistic (SSP5). Though pure stands had higher CO2 stock at the beginning, differences with regard to mixed stands were drastically reduced at the end of the simulation period. We also found an increase in the aboveground CO2 proportion compared to belowground in conifer–broadleaf mixtures, while the opposite trend occurred in conifer–conifer mixtures. Overall CO2 accumulation rates decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the simulation period, but our results indicated that this decline would be less drastic in mixed stands than in pure ones. At the end of the simulation period, CO2 accumulation rates were higher in mixed stands than in pure stands for all mixtures, fractions (aboveground and belowground) and SSPs. Knowing the evolution of mixed forests in different climate scenarios is relevant for developing useful silvicultural guidelines in the Mediterranean region and optimizing forestry adaptation strategies. Better understanding can also inform the design of management measures for transitioning from pure stands to more resource efficient, resistant and resilient mixed stands, in efforts to reduce forest vulnerability in the face of climate change. This work highlights the importance and benefits of mixed stands in terms of CO2 accumulation, stand productivity and species diversity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

National and international agencies promote the publication of governmental data as Linked Open Data, and research fields such as biosciences or cultural heritage make an extensive use of Semantic Web technologies. In this study, we present the result of the European Cross-Forest project, addressing the integration and publication of national forest inventories and land cover maps from Spain and Portugal using Semantic Web technologies. We used a bottom-up methodology to design the ontologies, with the goal of being generalizable to other countries and forestry datasets. First, we created an ontology for each dataset to describe the concepts (plots, trees, positions, measures, and so on) and relationships between the data in detail. We converted the source data into Linked Open Data by using the ontology to annotate the data such as species taxonomies. As a result, all the datasets are integrated into one place this is the Cross-Forest dataset and are available for querying and analysis through a SPARQL endpoint. These data have been used in real-world use cases such as (1) providing a graphical representation of all the data, (2) combining it with spatial planning data to reveal the forestry resources under the management of Spanish municipalities, and (3) facilitating data selection and ingestion to predict the evolution of forest inventories and simulate how different actions and conditions impact this evolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}{\textless}sec{\textgreater}{\textless}title{\textgreater}Discussion{\textless}/title{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The work started in the Cross-Forest project continues in current lines of research, including the addition of the temporal dimension to the data, aligning the ontologies and data with additional well-known vocabularies and datasets, and incorporating additional forestry resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Technological progress in the last decades has driven great advances in many fields of knowledge. A wide range of tools and services are now available and constantly evolving to handle vast amounts of available data as well as the increased complexity of real-world case studies and analytical alternatives. Most sectors have embraced new methodologies to provide solutions to their problems, and the forestry sector is no exception. Important steps have been taken to update the forestry sector and introduce new large-scale experimental designs, digital tools and more extensive forestry databases. However, assimilation of this progress by forest managers remains largely pending. The more specialized technical knowledge and computing skills required to use this new generation of tools constitutes a known barrier to uptake. In this work, we present the SIMANFOR cloud-based Decision Support System service for simulating forest management alternatives.

              Mixed forests are increasingly recognized for their resilience to climate change and enhanced ecosystem services (ESs) provision, making them a focal point for sustainable forest management strategies. This study examines the trade-offs in ESs provision between pure and different proportions of mixed stands of Scots pine (
              Pinus sylvestris
              L.) and Maritime pine (
              Pinus pinaster
              Ait.) in the Northern Iberian Range, Spain. Using the SIMANFOR simulation platform, we evaluated various silvicultural scenarios developed to obtain different ESs such as carbon sequestration, timber and mushroom yields. Our findings reveal that ESs provision varies depending on the forest type (pure or mixed) and the mixture proportion, following different trends on each ES. The initial species proportions and their maintenance were less critical than the management approach itself, which significantly influenced ESs outcomes. Focusing solely on individual ESs can lead to trade-offs, as highlighted by our study on silviculture focused on large saw timber yields. However, adopting a balanced approach that considers multiple ESs can mitigate these trade-offs. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of this approach in maximizing yields of mushrooms, sequestered carbon, and small saw timber. This research provides valuable insights for forest managers aiming to balance productivity and sustainability in ESs provision, providing strategies to maximize compatible ESs effectively.},
